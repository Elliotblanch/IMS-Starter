## Getting Started

* Fork repository https://github.com/Elliotblanch/IMS-Starter & clone to local machine
* Open Eclipse IDE

### Prerequisites

**Required**
Java
Eclipse IDE
MySQL



**Desirable**
SQL Workbench
Git Bash
VS Code



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

* Automated tests can be found in src/test/java, with package structure mimicking those found in src/main/java
* Tests are sorted by class, with all the tests of a given class being found in a class of with 'Test' added to the end of it's name
* e.g the tests for 'CustomerDAO' are found in 'CustomerDAOTest'
* To run tests in a given class, right click on the class, and click 'run as... -> JUnit Test'
* To run all tests, right click on the project file, and click 'run as... -> JUnit Test'
* To view test coverage, right click on the project file, and click 'coverage as... -> Junit Test'
### Unit Tests 

Unit tests inspect the methods found in the DAO files, which deal the data held in objects.

These tests will automatically run when you try to build the app with Maven.

### Integration Tests 
Integration tests inspect the controller classes, checking for any flaws in the user interface.

These tests will automatically run when you try to build the app with Maven.
